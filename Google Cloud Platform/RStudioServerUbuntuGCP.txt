1. Creating a VM instance

Navigate to your project
Click on compute engine
VM instances
CREATE INSTANCE
Set the Region and Zone to one that is close to you - make note of the region and zone, they will be important later on
Set the Series and Machine Type
Change Boot disk OS to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86/64
Click Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic

Create Firewall Rule
Name: rstudio
Target Tags*: http-server
Source IPv4 ranges" 0.0.0.0/0
Protocols and Ports
Check TCP and enter: 8787
Click Create



========================================================================================================================

2. Install dependencies and RStudio Server

Navigate to your project
Navigate to the VM instances page
Open a terminal by selecting the SSH button on the VM you created
Enter the following into the terminal:
	1. update packages
	sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
	
	2. Install required dependencies
	sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
	
	3. Install base R
	sudo apt -y install r-base r-base-dev

	4. Install reauired dependencies for tidyverse
	sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libfontconfig1-dev

	5. Install reauired dependencies for spatial libraries
	sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev libmysqlclient-dev libjq-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler -y

	6. Install RStudio Server
	wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/jammy/amd64/rstudio-server-2023.06.2-561-amd64.deb
	sudo gdebi rstudio-server-2023.06.2-561-amd64.deb

	7. Create a new user and password
	sudo adduser master
	New password: master
	Retype new password: master

3. Setting up GCS Fuse to mount storage buckets as a vm drive


Navigate to the VM instances page
Open a terminal by selecting SSH on the VM you created
Enter the following into the terminal:

	export GCSFUSE_REPO=gcsfuse-`lsb_release -c -s`

	echo "deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $GCSFUSE_REPO main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gcsfuse.list

	curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

	sudo apt-get update

	sudo apt-get install gcsfuse

EXIT the SSH in browser
Stop the VM instance by checking the box and selecting STOP
Click on the activate cloud shell button located on the upper right hand side of the page next to the notifications and support buttons
From the cloud shell change the permissions to give vm access to buckets change the machine name and zone to match yours:
 
	gcloud beta compute instances set-scopes rstudio-template --scopes=storage-full --zone=us-west4-a

When Prompted click on AUTHORIZE
Close the cloud shell by clicking on the X in the upper right hand corner
Start the VM instance by checing the box and selecting START

Navigate to the storage bucket you want to connect to the VM
Copy the name of the bucket.


Navigate to the VM instances page
Open a terminal by selecting SSH on the VM you created
Enter the following into the terminal (be sure to put the copied name of the bucket where it says name-of-bucket):

	1. get the uid (enter your username where it says master)
	id -u master

	2. get the gid (enter your username where is says master)
	id - g master

	3. create directories
	sudo mkdir -p /mnt/name-of-bucket

	4. change to allow write permissions
	sudo chmod a+w /mnt/name-of-bucket


	5. open up and edit the fstab document
	sudo nano /etc/fstab

	#paste these into the editor on new lines (enter the uid and gid from steps 1 and 2 above)
	name-of-bucket /mnt/name-of-bucket gcsfuse rw,_netdev,allow_other,uid=1002,gid=1003,file_mode=0776,dir_mode=0776
	
	6. ctrl o will write to the file, then press enter, then ctrl x to exit

	7. sudo reboot

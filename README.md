## Overview

Digital Soil Mapping - The generation of geographically referenced soil databases based on quantitative relationships between spatially explicit environmental data and measurements made in the field and laboratory (McBratney et al., 2003); the spatial prediction of soil classes or properties from point data and environmental raster data using a statistical algorithm.

## Webinars

- [Applied Digital Soil Mapping: Using pedology to understand, map, model, and manage landscapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLFWnUHDl4M) - Dr. Nauman explores how predictive statistical techniques in soil science can inform land management planning and decision making. Example applications include planning forest restoration, refining ecological sites, evaluating restoration of oil and gas drilling sites, determining dust sources, identifying salinity mitigation sites, mapping ecological states, and assessing landslide risk.
- [SDJR is Over, Now What?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw4rMB-4f78) - An update project using digital soil mapping methods in North Dakota.
- [Digital Soil Mapping in Practice: Essex County, VT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAwe4ccUCdY) - An initial mapping project using digital soil mapping methods in Vermont.
- [Soil Survey of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfoe-lm8-8o) - An initial mapping project using digital soil mapping methods in Minnesota.

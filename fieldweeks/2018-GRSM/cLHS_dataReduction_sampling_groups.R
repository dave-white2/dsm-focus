# cLHS stratified by sampling group with covariate reduction

#
#
# this script takes a raster stack, exracts based on sampling group boundary
# then performes a series of data reuction techniques to reduce the number of covariates while maximixing the variability of the total population that the selected set of covariates represent
#
# finally cLHS is used to generate a stratifified random sample of points across the subset sampling group

# before filtering we need to covert the raster stack to a dataframe this process is time consuming and ram intensive on large datasets, which is why we mask the raster stacks by sampling group. the covariate selection process implemeted below relies on dataframes for analysis.

# near Zero Variance filtering
#diagnoses predictors that have one unique value (i.e. are zero variance predictors) or predictors that are have both of the following characteristics: they have very few unique values relative to the number of samples and the ratio of the frequency of the most common value to the frequency of the second most common value is large.
